# H1 Tags and their effect on SEO

H1 is a special HTML tag that denotes the primary heading of a page. It should summarize what the primary purpose of the page is. Evidence has shown that having multiple H1 tags on the same page can adversely affect the SEO of that page. This is because it's a sign of sloppy use of the semantic meaning of the HTML tag. If you would like to having multiple headings on the page with large fonts, then instead create custom CSS classes and assign those.
