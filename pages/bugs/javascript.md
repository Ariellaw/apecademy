# JavaScript - can't live with it, can't live without it

JavaScript is one of the three main programming languages used when building a website (the other two being HTML and CSS).
Thanks to the flexibility of the language, you can make your site extra interactive, add animations, or make transparent requests to other services in the background.
What makes JavaScript so powerful also makes it so perilous.

Some common issues that can arise from misbehaving JS can be:

1. Browser hangs/lag from computationally heavy code running in the background of the site
2. Broken links due JavaScript errors that are triggered on click
3. Content not loading because of a bug causing the remote resources from not being pulled in properly.
4. Slow load times due to large bundles of JS code (often due to over dependence on large and bloated frameworks)
